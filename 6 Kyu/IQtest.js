// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task 
// in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers 
// differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually 
// differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his 
// answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers 
// finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, 
// which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
